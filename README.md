I enjoy idealizing, designing, developing, and implementing security solutions to fix, break or
exploit digital stuff. Long story short, I need to be involved with creativity and code, of course.

With over 15 years of experience, I spent most of this time testing, developing security
mechanisms, finding software vulnerabilities, and teaching software developers how they should
avoid them. I have extensive hands-on experience either in offensive and defensive perspectives,
which includes disciplines and skills like:

* Security Code Reviews 
* Penetration Testing 
* Secure Coding Training
* Threat Intelligence 
* Red Teaming
* Research & Development
* Threat Modeling
* DevSecOps 
* Cloud Security 
* Tooling 

On the other hand, I'm also a sociologist interested in the anthropological approach to hacker
culture and the impacts of technology on society.

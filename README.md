I enjoy idealizing, designing, developing, and implementing security solutions to fix, break or<br>
exploit digital stuff. Long story short, I need to be involved with creativity and code, of course.<br>

With over 13 years of experience, I spent most of this time testing, developing security<br>
mechanisms, finding software vulnerabilities, and teaching software developers how they should<br>
avoid them. I have extensive hands-on experience either in offensive and defensive perspectives,<br>
which includes disciplines and skills like:<br>

* Security Code Reviews 
* Penetration Testing 
* Secure Coding Training
* Threat Intelligence 
* Red Teaming
* Research & Development
* Threat Modeling
* DevSecOps 
* Cloud Security 
* Tooling 

As an independent researcher on IoT, I've identified several vulnerabilities and obtained some<br>
CVEs.  Lately, I have been developing an experimental security framework designed to audit web<br>
applications in python:https://github.com/s4dhulabs/vimana-framework<br>

Also, I have researched logic flaws for a while, and from that, I have created `LFWF:bD`, case<br>
studies on business logic flaws and insecure design scenarios:<br> 
https://github.com/s4dhulabs/LFWFBD<br>

On the other hand, I'm also a sociologist interested in the anthropological approach to hacker<br>
culture and the impacts of technology on society.<br>

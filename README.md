I enjoy idealizing, designing, developing, and implementing security solutions to fix, break or<br>
exploit digital stuff. Long story short, I need to be involved with creativity and code, of course.<br>

With over 15 years of experience, I spent most of this time testing, developing security<br>
mechanisms, finding software vulnerabilities, and teaching software developers how they should<br>
avoid them. I have extensive hands-on experience either in offensive and defensive perspectives,<br>
which includes disciplines and skills like:<br>

* Security Code Reviews 
* Penetration Testing 
* Secure Coding Training
* Threat Intelligence 
* Red Teaming
* Research & Development
* Threat Modeling
* DevSecOps 
* Cloud Security 
* Tooling 

On the other hand, I'm also a sociologist interested in the anthropological approach to hacker<br>
culture and the impacts of technology on society.
